# üèÄ Italian Basketball A League Analytics

Welcome to the **Italian Basketball A League Analytics** repository! This project is dedicated to analyzing and visualizing statistical data from the Italian Basketball A League, covering seasons from **2003-2004** to **2023-2024**. The goal is to provide insights and predictive models for key outcomes of the league, including playoff teams, finalists, the champion, and the MVP of the regular season.

## üìä Project Overview

This repository is divided into two main sections:

### 1. Streamlit Dashboard for Data Visualization
The first part of this project is focused on creating an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard that allows users to explore the statistical data from the Italian Basketball A League. Key features include:
- Visualization of historical data across multiple seasons.
- Comparison of historical data with new data from the upcoming **2024-2025** season (when available).
- Interactive tools to filter, sort, and compare players and teams across different seasons.

### 2. Predictive Models
The second part of the project involves developing predictive models based on the historical data. The models aim to predict the following outcomes:
- **Playoff Teams**: Predicting the top 8 teams that will qualify for the playoffs.
- **Playoff Finalists**: Predicting the two teams that will compete in the playoff final.
- **Season Champion**: Predicting the team that will win the championship.
- **MVP of the Regular Season**: Predicting the player who will be named the MVP.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for additional data visualization)

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/italian-basketball-analytics.git
cd italian-basketball-analytics
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Streamlit Dashboard
To start the Streamlit dashboard, simply run:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

This will launch the interactive dashboard in your web browser.

### Exploring the Data and Models
- Historical data is available in the `data/` directory.
- Predictive models are located in the `models/` directory.
- Notebooks detailing the analysis and model training process can be found in the `notebooks/` directory.

## üìà Data Sources
The datasets used in this project contain detailed statistical data for both players and teams across 20+ seasons of the Italian Basketball A League. These datasets include information such as:
- Player statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.)
- Team performance metrics (wins, losses, points per game, etc.)
- Playoff results
- MVP award winners
